# PyXMP
**Python X-Matching package**

## Description

During my work, I had to cross match sources a lot of times... So I created this repository to help people witht the same kind of specific needs ad I.  
  
This package is used in a specific context and is therefore not completely versatile. For simple and more accurate cross-matching, I recommend using the [CDS X-Match Service](http://cdsxmatch.u-strasbg.fr/#tab=userStore&) and [astropy astroquery python module](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#).
