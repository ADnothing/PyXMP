# PyXMP
*Python X-Matching package*

## Description

This python package contains a number of functions I've developed for cross-matching astronomical radio sources.  
This package is used in a specific context and is therefore not completely versatile. For simple and more accurate cross-matching, I recommend using the CDS X-Match Service and python module.
